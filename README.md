# firstpygame

building a basic "mini-framework" to build pygame apps with. Will support basic widgets, online/multiplayer, and multi-threading to help improve development of games, physics simulations, and simulators running on Python. 


images coming soon... 
  I'm going to use CPython to speed things up in terms of computations 
  Multi threading will take advantage of the CPU to distribute tasks related to backend API connections and main thread graphics
